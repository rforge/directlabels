latticedl presentation for semin-r group meeting.

I made a bunch of demo plotting code in LATTICE.R and
LATTICEDL.R. Each plot is commented. We use convert.py to convert the
R code to Sweave code, and add it to the Rnw file. We then run Sweave
on the Rnw file, producing a tex file. We post-process the tex file
using killplot.py to delete the obligatory plot() calls. Finally we
process with pdflatex to produce slides in pdf format.

R -convert> Rnw -Sweave> tex -killplot> tex -pdflatex> pdf
