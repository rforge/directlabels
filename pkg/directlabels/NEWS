Need to figure out how to calculate label bounding boxes for ggplot2.

closest.on.ahull calculation should take into account visual
coordinates, not plotting coordinates (could run into problems if
horiz and vert axes are on widely different scales).

1.3 no longer depend on ggplot2/proto for further modularity.

path example datasets.

redo ggplot2 backend --- analyze layers to determine which has the
color.

Respect predefined scale_colour_manual() in ggplot2:

I tried to do a hack that looks into p$scales$.scales to turn off the
legend (r371), but that didn't work so well, so I went back to the
method of just adding a new scale_colour_discrete(legend=FALSE) (r382)
You could always set the scale_colour_manual AFTER the call to direct.label():
p <- ggplot(...)
p2 <- direct.label(p)
p2+scale_colour_manual(...,legend=FALSE)
As of r400 I do analysis of the layers of the ggplot object, and turn off
 the color legend off if there was one. Thus this should be equivalent:
p <- ggplot(...)+
  scale_colour_manual(...)
direct.label(p)

gapply function for applying a Positioning Method to each group.

1.1 26 nov 2010 delete many examples so CRAN check completes quicker.

1.0 16 nov 2010 initial release attempted to CRAN -- too many examples.
